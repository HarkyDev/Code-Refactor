# Code Refactor

## Project summary
This project was to show my ability to improve mostly working code and make it more appropriate when it comes to SEO optimization in terms of "h" tag usage, using correct semantics in "HTML" and 
"CSS" elements for example the correct usages of "div" and "section" tags etc. Also making sure that any features that the page has are consistent through the whole site and making sure that it meets accessibility standards.

### Reasons for some of my choices
I chose for instance to use a div for the elements on the right as they were already inside an "aside" tag which I felt declared them as elements with content in them already. I Chose to use the section tags for the elements on the left as they were full of important content, especially considering they contain the h2 tags.

The brief did not show a footer, However I chose to leave it in the with the code that was given to us as I didn't think it made much sense to remove it as it only added to how informative the piece was.
I also chose to condense a lot of the css as the exact results could be achieved in much less code 

I also used "prettier" to clean up and format the code to make it much more presentable
